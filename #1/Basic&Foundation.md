# What Is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that helps make websites interactive. While HTML builds the structure of a page, and CSS styles it, JavaScript brings it to life like making buttons clickable, showing pop-up messages, updating content without refreshing the page, or creating animations.

## Think of a website as a robot:
- HTML is the skeleton (structure)
- CSS is the skin and clothes (style)
- JavaScript is the brain and muscles (behavior)

## For example:
- You click a "Subscribe" button → JavaScript handles that click, sends your email to the server, and shows a message like "Thanks for subscribing!"
- You scroll → JavaScript can load more content on the page without refreshing.

Modern JavaScript is very powerful — it’s not only used in browsers, but also on servers, apps, and even IoT devices thanks to platforms like Node.js.
