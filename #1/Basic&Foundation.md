## ðŸ“– What Is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that helps make websites interactive. While HTML builds the structure of a page, and CSS styles it, JavaScript brings it to life like making buttons clickable, showing pop-up messages, updating content without refreshing the page, or creating animations.

#Think of a website as a robot:
ðŸ§± HTML is the skeleton (structure)
ðŸŽ¨ CSS is the skin and clothes (style)
ðŸ§  JavaScript is the brain and muscles (behavior)

#For example:

You click a "Subscribe" button â†’ JavaScript handles that click, sends your email to the server, and shows a message like "Thanks for subscribing!"

You scroll â†’ JavaScript can load more content on the page without refreshing.

Modern JavaScript is very powerful â€” itâ€™s not only used in browsers, but also on servers, apps, and even IoT devices thanks to platforms like Node.js.
